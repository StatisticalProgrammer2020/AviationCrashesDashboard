# A Dashboard on Aviation Crashes

This is a dashboard project that I made using RShiny on aviation crashes. This dashboard aims to describe how aviation crashes have evolved over the years (and whether or not certain planes, operators, or aircrafts are safe flying at). I chose to do this project in RShinyDashboard rather than Tableau given the level of difficulty and the learnings that I can get from using a programming language.
